# Beluga Depths

The theme of the jam is "Behind the veil"

Primary game mechanic: Beluga Whale Sonar/Echolocation

You will be a beluga whale in the depths of the artic ocean. You must find and eat other fishes using echolocation because it is dark deep beneath the artic ice. Watch out for hidden preditors that would eat you.

## Environment

Dark, deeper you go the less you can see normally. Everything becomes obscured. Echolocation will be the primary method of navigating the ice.

- The background could color change with the depth. Ligher near the surface. Darker and more desaturated deeper. 

At the surface there could be breathing holes to come up and get air. After all Beluga Whales breath air. Could work around this to make a challenge.

*Air bubbles appear to help aquire air in difficult areas???*

## Echo-location

Visually it'll allow you to see blobs of areas that your sonar bounces off of breifely

Beluga whale melon is jiggly

The beluga whale's neck is funcitonal so make it so you can look around more??

- *need to figure out how to project a sonar*
- *need to figure out how to hide and reveal things on screen*
- *Toph Beifong???*

## Movement

If i can manage it, make the body follow behind the head sortof like a snake to make it look cool???

Beluga whales have a functional neck unlike most whales with fused spine??

## Your Prey
- *needs more research on what beluga whales eat*

## Your Preditors
- *needs more research on what eats beluga whales*
- get short warning of vibrations of preditor but no definitive visuals, makes you keep watching your back. Gotta make the player paranoid.

## Other deep horrors
- human submarines? divers? boss battle?
