# Beluga Depths

The theme of the jam is "Behind the veil"

Primary game mechanic: Beluga Whale Sonar/Echolocation

You will be a beluga whale in the depths of the artic ocean. You must find and eat other fishes using echolocation because it is dark deep beneath the artic ice. Watch out for hidden preditors that would eat you.

## Environment

Dark, deeper you go the less you can see normally. Everything becomes obscured. Echolocation will be the primary method of navigating the ice.

- The background could color change with the depth. Ligher near the surface. Darker and more desaturated deeper. 

Artic Icebergs could make the environment hard to navigate, possibly maze like? random generation?
This would make it so breathing holes are limited

At the surface there could be breathing holes to come up and get air. After all Beluga Whales breath air. Could work around this to make a challenge.

*Air bubbles appear to help aquire air in difficult areas???*


## Echo-location

Visually it'll allow you to see blobs of areas that your sonar bounces off of breifely

- moving objects such as fish and falling debris should disappear from vision faster
- non-moving objects should remain visible for longer

- needs to make beluga sounds, audible feedback

Beluga whale melon is jiggly

The beluga whale's neck is funcitonal so make it so you can look around more??

- *need to figure out how to project a sonar*
- *need to figure out how to hide and reveal things on screen*
- *Toph Beifong???*

## Movement

If i can manage it, make the body follow behind the head sortof like a snake to make it look cool???

Beluga whales have a functional neck unlike most whales with fused spine??

## Your Prey
- *needs more research on what beluga whales eat*

- they eat fish and squid, nothing human sized

## Your Preditors
- *needs more research on what eats beluga whales*
- get short warning of vibrations of preditor but no definitive visuals, makes you keep watching your back. Gotta make the player paranoid.

### killer whales

these will be main preditor
should be very scary for the player
make it very panicy to run away
always having to look over your shoulder to spot them in time

jump scares?

appears frequently?

### polar bears

*due to climate change they come to hunt beluga whales which is dangerous for them*

imagine coming up for air and a polar bear jumps onto you. that's a horror game scenario
- *should the players be able to detect them?*

could target breathing holes to make player paranoid

## Other deep horrors
- human submarines? divers? boss battle?

sonar should be a big part of a boss battle. the sound waves are powerful and should hurt.
the sonar is very disruptive in the lives of aquatic creatures
- debris can block the sonar waves.
- the waves come out as circle
- you don't hear them until you are within the radius of the sonar ping as it passes by
- the sonar waves should reveal terrain and other things but quickly disappear
- ~~you must use your own echolocation to view the source of the sonar pings???~~
- when you are hurt by the sonar you should be temporarily blinded??
    - possibly make it so you can only see the stuff the sonar ping revealed but blinded to what your echolocation has seen?

the boss introduction so involve coming through a tunnel/ opening and having to dodge the sonar waves until you reach the battle arena. 

### submarine boss??
if i were to do a submarine boss it would be based on a sub that is on eternal patrol, to make it spooky

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lost_Russian_or_Soviet_submarines

- leading torpedos to crash into icebergs and cause ice/rock to fall and hit the sub??

### oil rig, or an offshore seismic survey ship boss??
these ships use seismic sonar air gunny thing to blast waves to find oil deep beneath the ocean floor
they trail behind sonar equipment and microphone things

- sink the ship??
